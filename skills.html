        <h1>Skills</h1>

        <p>I know several programming languages. A lot of what I know is self taught. With Java I learned from two
            ID-Tech camps. These camps are a week long and teach you the basics of that language. The rest I learned
            through trial-and-error. One thing that speed up my knowledge of Java was that I programmed plugins for a
            game as a hobby. That forced me to learn good programming teqniques. C# was also learned through a little
            bit of a camp but the majority was from my knowledge of Java since the languages are so similar. C++ was
            learned through a camp and my knowledge of previous languages. HTML and CSS was self-taught and through the
            program <a onclick="openmenu()" href="#westmec">west-mec</a>.</p>
        <p>I have made several projects in Java. My top projects are a <a href="https://github.com/ryandw11/New-Java-Tic-Tac-Toe">gui
                - tic-tac-toe game</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/ryandw11/Game-Engine">pong
                replica</a>. I
            have tons of projects in java and I love to mess around with the language. With C# I have several projects.
            My prize project is the game I've been programming called <a href="https://github.com/ryandw11/Cities-Sandbox">Cities
                Sandbox</a>. I've made some other <a href="https://github.com/ryandw11?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%23">Libraries</a>
            in CSS for unity. As for C++ I have a few <a href="https://github.com/ryandw11?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c%2B%2B">projects</a>.
            For html and css I have <a href="https://github.com/RWahl005?tab=repositories">these projects</a>.
